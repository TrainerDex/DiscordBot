# Migrating

We recently updated the bot to use slash commands. They're fairly self explanitary but heres were you can find them


 - `.approve`/`.ap` has moved to `/approve`
 - `.trnr`/`.trainer`/`.profile`/`.whois`/`.progress` -> `/profile`
 - `.lb`/`.leaderboard` -> `/leaderboard`

### Welcome messages
The bot no longer handles welcome messages and logging. It's just out of the scope of what I want to do. [Dyno](https://dyno.gg/) is a great alternative to that.

### Pokecord
Pokecord is no longer supported. It's just out of the scope of what I want to do. Find their dedicated bot [here](https://pokecord.xyz/)
